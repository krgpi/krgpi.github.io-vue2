    Our object and a goal of this project is to compensate weakness of print media by digital media and to tell people about goodness of printing matter. With the widespread use of digital media, the number of print media is decreasing. However, there are strengths as the shapes of the book and the wonderful color expression. On the other hand, there are features that only be found in digital media such as videos, 3D interactive models.

    This project was founded by chief, but he is not familiar with internet technology. So he wanted us to give some creative ideas which solve problems above. For example, I considered and implemented the idea that we could change the content. This idea provides the user with the pleasure that parts of the book change every month.</p>

    Smart speaker, such as Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri is becoming
    ubiquitously available for the last few years. However, much research reported
    that users could not naturally interact with these commercial products since
    users need explicit utterances, which is also known as wake up words to activate
    them. Since a smooth conversation is obtained by several nonverbal behaviour
    and verbal behaviour, I considered adding nonverbal behavior to smart speaker
    could achieve a smoother conversation. To achieve the purpose, I conducted an
    experiment to observe the participants ’natural movement while interacting
    with a smart speaker or a human. By video analysis, I extracted the significant nonverbal behaviour and considered them as important features in such
    conversation. Later, I implemented a prototype of smart speaker that support
    these features as activate function instead of wake up words. The result of
    evaluation shows that it is effective to use nonverbal behavior to activate a
    smart speaker.
